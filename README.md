# strom
[nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom/) inspired string parser in rust

[nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom/) is a great parser combinator implementation, but lacks some important features:

* recognize! for &str
* caseless tag!
* information about location in source

All these features are useful for my purposes (Visual Basic Parser).
